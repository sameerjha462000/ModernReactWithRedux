1. Open another terminal and type "npm install json-server".

2. Now create a file in the root directory named as "db.json".

3. Now add the following code :
	{
		"books": []
	}

4. Now add the following in package.json in "scripts" :
	"server" : "json-server -p 3001 --watch db.json"

	This will start the json server on the port 3001 as port 3000 is already used by react.
	The instruction is to watch the file db.json in the root directory.

5. Now type the following code in the terminal :
	"npm run server"

6. Also install the REST Client extension in the VSCode.
